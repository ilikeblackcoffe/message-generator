# Mixed Messages 

## Codecademy Portfolio Project

>This is a mixed messages project by codecademy study platform.
>>The Project Objectives are: 
>> - to build a message generator program using JavaScript. 
>> - use Git version control. 
>> - use command line and develop locally on your computer.

My idea was to create a simple interface combined with yellow color tones with  a button that when triggered select a random bible verse and displays on the end of the page. I didn't use API(the project doesn't order to use it but I challenged myself to try anyway, but I couldn't do it).So I created a short Array with 6 verses that are randomly choosed.  

The button style was created by [Joe Bacock](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples)
